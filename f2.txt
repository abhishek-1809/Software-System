Hi
I am Abhishek
We declare a FILE pointer fp to represent the file.
We specify the file name ("example.txt") and a buffer (buffer) to store each line.
We open the file in read-only mode ("r") using fopen. If the file cannot be opened, we print an error message and exit.
We enter a loop that reads lines from the file using fgets. The loop continues until fgets returns NULL, indicating the end of file.
Inside the loop, we print each line using printf.
After the loop, we close the file using fclose.
